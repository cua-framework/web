# Introduction

This repository uses GitHub Pages to host all webpages used in testcases for Computer-Use Agents (CUAs) and Browser-Use Agents (BUAs). Each testcase's webpage is accessible via a URL structured as follows:

```
https://cua-framework.github.io/web/{platform}/?id={testcase}
```

An example URL is https://cua-framework.github.io/web/email/?id=delf, where `{platform} = "email"` and `{testcase} = "delf"`. Please refer to [our HuggingFace repository](https://huggingface.co/datasets/VPI-Bench/vpi-bench) for all the testcase URLs used.

Additionally, note that for the `"email"` and `"messenger"` platforms, there's an optional query parameter `load`, which can be used to specify which email/message to display initially. This parameter is only used for the Late and Early Injection Experiment, and is not used in the Main Benchmark.

## Platforms

| Platform Name | `{platform}` Value |
| ------------- | ------------------ |
| Amazon        | `webplatform`      |
| BBC           | `webplatform2`     |
| Booking       | `webplatform1`     |
| Email         | `email`            |
| Messenger     | `messenger`        |
